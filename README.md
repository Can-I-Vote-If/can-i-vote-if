# Can I Vote If?

## Intro
> Can I Vote If? (CIVI) was born about of the [CodeSwitch](http://www.codeswitch.mn/) hackathon in Sept 2017. Created by [Jenessa White](github.com/jenessawhite) after hearing [Jason Sole](https://twitter.com/iamjasonsole) from the panel on Saturday morning talk about how he had just regained his right to vote. 

>Voting laws in the United States vary based on mainly 4 areas:
> - Citizenship
> - Age
> - Residency
> - Criminal History

> This can make it very confusing and difficult for people to vote in this country and ultimately lead to stories like [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/31/598458914/texas-woman-sentenced-to-5-years-for-illegal-voting).
