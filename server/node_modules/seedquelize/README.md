# seedquelize

> Seed your database with [Sequelize](sequelizejs.com).
>
> Add initial data to your database so that you don't need to create dummy data each time you boot up your app in development.  
>
> You can also use this when running end-to-end tests since you'll need consistent data to test against.

## Getting Started

### Background

Typically you want to seed your database before your express or other app begins.  This means it needs to sit in between the spot where you define your sequelize models and where you serve your app.  

**NOTE: You also will want to make sure that you don't run this in production since it will remove all the data. :)**

### Installation

```
npm install seedquelize --save-dev
```

### Usage

This example shows how to use seedquelize with express sequelize and postgres.  It uses the following npm modules which you will have to install on your own:  `express`, `body-parser`, `sequelize` and `pg` as dependencies and `seedquelize` and `dotenv-safe` as dev dependencies.  You will need to npm install all of those dependencies for this example to work. You can also check out the examples directory.

Your database config info should be in a .env file. I've commented this file as much as possible to show how to use seeding in an actual app. Pull requests are welcome in order to make this more clear.

```js
let seed;

if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  require('dotenv-safe').config() // environment variables, used for hiding secrets
  seed = require('seedquelize')
}

const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const Sequelize = require('sequelize')

// Connect to a sql database
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

const Artist = sequelize.define('artist', {
  name: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    field: 'name'
  },
  genre: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    field: 'genre'
  }
})

const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  username: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    field: 'username'
  },
  twitter: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    field: 'twitter'
  }
})

// This line saves your job by not deleting production data
if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  
  // Clear out the existing database
  sequelize.sync({force: true}).then(() => {
    
    // This shows the shape of the structure we are expecting.
    // data is just an array of whatever models you want to create,
    // model is of course the actual model you want created
    const artists = {
      data: [
        {
          name: 'Andrea Bocelli',
          genre: 'Opera'
        },
        {
          name: 'Britney Spears',
          genre: 'Pop'
        },
        {
          name: 'Lee Morgan',
          genre: 'Jazz'
        }
      ],
      model: Artist
    }

    const users = {
      data: [
        {
          username: 'jimthedev',
          twitter: '@jimthedev'
        },
        {
          username: 'jnessview',
          twitter: 'JNessView'
        }
      ],
      model: User
    }

    // Actually seed the database using seedquelize
    seed([
      artists,
      users
    ]).then(() =>{
      // Only started after seeding in dev/test
      startExpress();
    })
  })
} else {
  // Started right away in prod
  startExpress();
}

function startExpress() {
  // Create a new express app to server our api
  var app = express()

  // Teach express how to parse requests of type application/json
  //
  app.use(bodyParser.json());

  // Teach express how to parse requests of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  //
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
  
  app.get('/api/artists', (req, res) => {
    Artist.findAll().then((artists) => {
      res.json(artists);
    })
  })
  app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    User.findAll().then((users) => {
      res.json(users);
    })
  })
  // Determine which port to listen on
  const port = process.env.PORT ? process.env.PORT : 3001

  // Actually start the server
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('Example app listening on port ' + port + '!')
  })
}


```
